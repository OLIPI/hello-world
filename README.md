# hello-world
want to find out what is really important for me.

Okay,let's see how many new words I get so far:

workflow “工作流程”， repository “资源库”， branch “分支”, commit “提交”， pull requests “合并请求”， essentials “要素”， install “安装”， the command line “命令行”， readme “自述文件”，default “系统默认值”， diagram “图表”， feature “特性”， initialize “初始化”， snapshot “快照”， associated “关联的”， capture “捕捉”.
